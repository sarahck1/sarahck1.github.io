            My Melody is a little white bunny who is most often seen with her pink or red hood. This is because when she first debuted she was representing "Little Red Riding Hood." She is also often seen with a flower or bow on her hood. She is very good-natured, honest, and overall very generous. She enjoys baking, specificially almond cakes, and she loves her friends.
